# Ethical Banking in the US

This document is focused on climate-based ethical banking, __*specifically fossil fuel divestment*__. Green/sustainable investments are mandatory for us to move away from fossil fuels, but [nothing would accelerate the reduction of CO2 emissions the way that fossil fuel divestment would](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/money-is-the-oxygen-on-which-the-fire-of-global-warming-burns).

There is more info on other social issues on each company's website. That said, Amalgamated has by far the most efforts across all issues.
